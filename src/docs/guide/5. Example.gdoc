There's an example usage for @ext-desktop@ template here:

{code}
http://dev.aplaline.com/git/grails-extjs-example.git
{code}

Since this is an example that uses this plugin in source form you need to clone the [grails-extjs.git|http://dev.aplaline.com/git/grails-extjs.git] project on the same level as the [grails-extjs-example.git|http://dev.aplaline.com/git/grails-extjs-example.git] so that the directory structure looks like this:

{code}
grails-extjs
grails-extjs-example
{code}
